Salt install, config, and start
===============================

Salt Project repository configuration
=====================================
Salt Project provides a public repository for packages at the `Salt Project Package Repo <https://repo.saltproject.io/>`__.

The preferred method for installing Salt is via distribution packages, which ensures that all dependencies are met and that Salt is installed in a tested and distribution-aligned way.
Salt is often distributed in split packages, but only ``salt-master`` and ``salt-minion`` are required for Salt to function.

.. Note::

   The following examples only cover Debian and Redhat platforms. Instructions for other platforms can be found at the `Salt Project Package Repo <https://repo.saltproject.io/>`__.

RedHat installation
-------------------
Operating systems in the RedHat family install via ``yum``.

#.  Add the Salt repository:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo rpm --import https://repo.saltproject.io/py3/redhat/8/x86_64/latest/SALTSTACK-GPG-KEY.pub
        curl -fsSL https://repo.saltproject.io/py3/redhat/8/x86_64/latest.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/salt.repo

#.  Refresh or expire your local package cache, if necessary:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo yum clean expire-cache

#.  Install packages:

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo yum install salt-master
        sudo yum install salt-minion

Debian installation
-------------------
Operating systems in the Debian family install via ``apt``.

#.  Add the Salt repository:

    .. code-block:: bash

       # Download key
       sudo curl -fsSL -o /usr/share/keyrings/salt-archive-keyring.gpg https://repo.saltproject.io/py3/ubuntu/20.04/amd64/latest/salt-archive-keyring.gpg

       # Create apt sources list file
       echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/salt-archive-keyring.gpg] https://repo.saltproject.io/py3/ubuntu/20.04/amd64/latest focal main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/salt.list

#.  Install packages:

    .. code-block:: bash

       sudo apt install salt-master
       sudo apt install salt-minion


Platform-agnostic installation
------------------------------
Salt can be installed in an platform-agnostic way via the Python package installer ``pip`` from `pypi.org <https://pypi.org>`_.
``Pip`` can also install other packages that will complement your Salt code.

#.  Install package:

    .. code-block:: bash

       pip install salt

A benefit of using ``pip`` is the ability to install Salt in Python virtual environments and Conda environments.

Salt Bootstrap installation
===========================
The `Salt Bootstrap project <https://bootstrap.saltproject.io>`_ maintains a shell script that installs Salt on any Linux/Unix platform.
The script installs system packages and enables Salt services automatically.

The bootstrap script can be used to install specific services:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Download the install script
    curl -o bootstrap-salt.sh -L https://bootstrap.saltproject.io

    # Install minion service (default)
    ./bootstrap-salt.sh

    # Install both the Salt master and minion
    ./bootstrap-salt.sh -M

    # Install just the Salt master service
    ./bootstrap-salt.sh -M -N

    # Perform a pip-based installation
    ./bootstrap-salt.sh -P

    # Download and run
    curl -L https://bootstrap.saltproject.io | sudo sh -s --

    # Download and install a specific git branch/version
    curl -L https://bootstrap.saltproject.io | sudo sh -s -- git develop

Salt network ports
==================
The Salt master/minion model only requires inbound connections into the Salt master.
Connections are established from the minion and never from the master.

``salt-master`` offers two services to the minions:

* ``4505`` - Event Publisher/Subscriber port (publish jobs/events)
    * Constant inquiring connection

* ``4506`` - Data payloads and minion returns (file services/return data)
    * Connects only to deliver data

.. image:: ../_static/img/minion-subcription-publication-model.jpg
   :align: right
   :alt: Minion subscription publication

.. Note::
    Minions do not have to have a master to be managed. A ``salt-minion`` can execute commands locally with ``salt-call --local [module.function]``.

Basic master configuration
==========================

* The ``salt-master`` comes with default server configurations.
* The default master YAML configuration at ``/etc/salt/master`` contains all the commented settings.
* Custom settings are added in YAML to ``/etc/salt/master.d/`` as ``.conf`` files on the master.
* The default master file should be used for referencing settings as needed.

Salt master network settings
----------------------------
By default, the master binds to all available network interfaces, then listens on ports ``4505`` and ``4506``.

This example overrides the default settings:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: /etc/salt/master.d/network.conf

    # The network interface to bind to
    interface: 192.168.42.20

    # The Request/Reply port
    ret_port: 4506

    # The port minions bind to for commands, aka the publish port
    publish_port: 4505

Salt master process management
------------------------------
If your cluster has thousands of minions, and your minion reports are stalling, the master might be timing out the job's minion responses.
This may mean that the minions failed their job, but it could instead mean that the master doesn’t have enough worker threads to process all the reports.

To manage the ``salt-minion`` return calls, the master threads out worker processes with the ``worker_threads`` setting.
The default limit for the processes is five workers.
The minimum limit is three workers.

Example setting in a master configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: /etc/salt/master.d/thread_options.conf

    worker_threads: 5

Standards for busy environments:

* Use one worker thread per 200 minions
* The value of ``worker_threads`` should not exceed 1½ times the available CPU cores

Basic minion configuration
===========================
* The ``salt-minion`` comes default with a DNS/hostname configuration setup.
* The default minion YAML configuration at ``/etc/salt/minion`` contains all the commented settings.
* Custom settings are added in YAML to ``/etc/salt/minion.d/`` as ``.conf`` files on the minion.
* The default minion file should be used for referencing settings as needed.

Connecting to the Salt master
-----------------------------
By default, the minions assume that the Salt master can be resolved in DNS via the hostname ``salt``.

An example that overrides the hostname default setting:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: /etc/salt/minion.d/master.config

    master: 192.168.42.20

Declaring the minion ID
-----------------------
The ``salt-minion`` will identify itself to the master by the system’s hostname unless explicitly set:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: /etc/salt/minion.d/id.conf

    id: rebel_1

Salt key exchange
=================
For security, Salt uses key-based authentication.

Two types of keys are used in Salt:

* RSA
* AES

Salt keys
---------
The RSA keys are the backbone to the authentication and encryption model used by Salt.
All Salt daemons run with unique RSA keys.
The minions and master generate RSA keys when they start for the first time, and then use them for PKI-based authentication.

These keys are used to authenticate the AES key to the Salt master, providing secure communication by encrypting data.
Each minion presents a public key to the Salt master.
The key is then examined, compared, and explicitly accepted by an administrator.

The master also sends a rotating AES key that is used to encrypt and decrypt messages sent by the Salt master.
The returned AES key is encrypted using the public key initially sent by the Salt minion, and can therefore be decrypted only by the same Salt minion.

.. image:: ../_static/img/salt-pki-model.png
   :align: right
   :alt: Salt PKI model

.. Note::
    Salt minions do not receive data from the Salt master until the key is accepted.

Managing keys
-------------
The ``salt-key`` command is used to interface with the authentication system to accept, reject, and otherwise manage keys.

Accepting keys
--------------
When a new minion checks in, the key will wait in ``Unaccepted keys`` until it is accepted.

Call ``salt-key`` to see the current state of key management:

.. code-block:: bash

    salt-key

Example response:

.. code-block:: bash

    Unaccepted Keys:
    db1
    Accepted Keys:
    web1
    web2
    Rejected:
    badguy

In this example, to accept keys, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    salt-key -a db1

If there are multiple keys to accept and are trusted, you can accept all at once:

.. code-block:: bash

    salt-key -A

.. Warning::
    A master that is open to the internet is considered a security vulnerability.

Deleting keys
-------------
Keys can also be deleted singularly or in bulk. Because this is a permanent action, running the command will give a [n/Y] prompt for confirmation.

Deleting a single key:

.. code-block:: bash

    salt-key -d web1

Example response:

.. code-block:: bash

    The following accepted key is set to be removed:
    web1
    [n/Y]

Deleting all keys:

.. code-block:: bash

    salt-key -D

Example response:

.. code-block:: bash

    The following keys are going to be deleted:
    web1
    web2
    [n/Y]

Deleting keys via a filter:

.. code-block:: bash

    salt-key -d 'web*'

Example response:

.. code-block:: bash

    The following keys are going to be deleted:
    web1
    web2
    [n/Y]

Starting Salt services
======================
Using ``systemctl`` is the main way to start Salt processes.
Calling the process directly will show the active logs in the foreground.

Start with ``systemctl``
------------------------
When starting ``salt-master`` and ``salt-minion``, using ``systemctl`` is recommended.

.. code-block:: bash

    systemctl start salt-master
    systemctl start salt-minion

``systemctl`` is also useful for preliminary debugging and process start/stop confirmation:

.. code-block:: bash

    systemctl [start|status|stop] [salt-master|salt-minion]

Starting in the foreground
---------------------------
The ``salt-master`` and ``salt-minion`` daemons can show their logs in the terminal by calling their processes directly:

.. code-block:: bash

    salt-master
    salt-minion

Verifying a Salt installation
=============================
After a successful installation of Salt:

#.  With ``systemctl``, check that the Salt master is running and logs no errors:

    .. code-block:: text

        systemctl status salt-master

    Example response:

    .. code-block:: text
