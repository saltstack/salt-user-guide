Writing Salt documentation
==========================

Version 1.0 - last updated February 2021

Introduction
============
Welcome to the Salt documentation guide! All of the Salt Project documentation
is written in reStructured Text (rST), a flavor of Markdown that is specifically
designed to work with Python-based projects. This guide will explain how we
want you to format your rST.


This topic is a stub for now, but will cover:

- Callouts (warnings, notes)
- Headers
- Code blocks (including how to reference file names)
- Formatting file names and functions in the text
- Images
- Ordered vs. unordered lists
- Line endings and breaks in the code
